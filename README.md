Hello!  Thank you for visiting this repo!

This is my Pokedex.

I was looking for an API to build an app around and practice some Asynchronous Javascript, but I did not want to build another weather app.  So I scoured the web and found some great Pokemon APIs.

The app makes use of several different APIs:

-https://pokeapi.co/
-https://pokeres.bastionbot.org/

I got inspiration for the main styles from:

I built the app with React and had some fun with the Intro Animation.
